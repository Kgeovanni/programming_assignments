The link to my PA4 is: https://pthane.github.io/pa4ds4ling/slides/index.html

Two comments:
1). I named the repo pa4ds4ling, because I have another repo named pa4 from last year's phonology course.  I want to keep that because I sometimes refer back to those projects.
2). I resubmitted this assignment.  This should be the second request to merge into the repo.
