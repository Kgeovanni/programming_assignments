## Assignment 4

**Topics**: Project management, tidying data, HTML Presentations

### Overview

In this assignment you will create an RStudio project in which you get, tidy, transform, analyze and plot data from a publicly available dataset. 
You will host your project in a GitHub repo and create HTML slides to present your analysis. 

**Assigned**: 03/04  
**Due**:  Wednesday, 03/10 before 10pm

### Instructions

1. Create a new project in RStudio called `pa4`. 
Inside your new project, create three folders: `data_raw`, `data_tidy`, and `slides`.
2. Download the dataset available [here][pa4_fricatives] and store it in `data_raw`. 
3. Generate an HTML presentation using **xaringan**. 
Save the RMarkdown file as `index.Rmd` inside of the folder `slides`.
4. Load the dataset from your `index.Rmd` file. 
5. Tidy the data and save the tidy version as a .csv file in `data_tidy`. 
6. Provide a table of descriptive statistics. 
7. Make a boxplot of center of gravity as a function of phoneme. 
In another slide, plot skewness as a function of phoneme. 
Use a statistical transformation (i.e., not a boxplot).
8. Fit a model that examines center of gravity as a function of skewness for 
the [s] segments (hint: you will have to transform the data). 
Make a table of the model summary.
9. Make a scatter plot that illustrates the relationship in (8). 
10. Check model diagnostics (make plots). 
11. Write up the results (as if it were for a journal article).
12. Host your project in a GitHub repo called `pa4`. 
13. Turn the slides into a website using GitHub pages. 
14. Inside your dropbox in `programming_assignments`, create a folder called 
`pa4` that includes a `README.md` file with a link to your slides. 
15. Push changes to your forked version of `programming_assignments` and submit a pull request to the master `programming_assignments` repo in ds4ling.

### Evaluation

| **Total**                              |     10 |


### Tips

- Follow every instruction step-by-step. 
- Worry about tidying your data, fitting your models, making plots, etc., 
**before** you worry about making the presentation (i.e., making each 
individual slide). It might be a good idea to use an R script first, as we 
have done in class, and then turn it into a presentation. 
- Search for help when you get stuck, use stackoverflow and slack. 
- Think of this PA as a practice exam. 
Use all of the skills you have developed up to this point in the class.
- Review fetching changes in GitHub (to update your **programming_assignments** 
repo) and submitting pull-requests (to 'turn in' your assignment).
